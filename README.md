Hello, I'm Charlie Roselius, currently at Amihan Entertainment after 11 years at Riot Games.

Interested in collaborating on game mods in general, I've dabbled in Brood War (Heaven's Last Stand, Helm's Deep mapmaking), Battle for Wesnoth, various Tabletop Simulator ports, and others.

I've tinkered with some Discord bots for gaming communities.

Read [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/), it's excellent.
